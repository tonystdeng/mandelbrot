this is a c# program using the monogame framework to display mandelbrot set
in the program, use wasd to control positions, up/down to controll zoom, and left/right to controll resolution

to run the game, download the compressed folder or just the folder with your operating system's name on it, we currently only have linux64 and win64 supported
make sure you have the dotnet frame work downloaded to run this
in terminall, make sure you are in the app folder, then run "dotnet mandelbrot.dll"
then, just enjoy your mandelbrot set! don't break your computer because it is power demanding!
